**Project Title:** Cyclistic Bike-Share 2019 Analysis — My First Case Study

**About the Project:** This is my first full case study in data analytics, where I cleaned and explored 3.2M+ bike trip records using Python and Jupyter.
I focused on uncovering rider patterns by gender, age, and usage time.
The dataset contains over 3.2 million trips collected throughout 2019. I focused on:
- Cleaning raw CSV data using Pandas and NumPy
- Fixing datatypes, handling missing values, and creating new features like rider age
- Exploring rider behavior by gender, user type, and age groups
- Visualizing patterns by hour of day, day of week, and popular station routes

**Dataset Overview:**
- 📅 Year: 2019 (Cyclistic Bike Share)
- 🔢 Rows: 3.2 million+
- 📁 Columns: Trip info, user demographics, start/end stations
- 📦 Source: Divvy Open Data (bike sharing)

**Tools Used:**
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn

**Key Insights:**
- 🚻 Most riders were male and aged 30–45
- 🕒 Peak usage during weekday commute hours (8–9AM, 5–6PM)
- 📍 Top stations centered around downtown Chicago
- ⏳ Customers took longer rides than subscribers

**Visualizations:**
- Bar chart: Trips by Gender
- Boxplot: Trip Duration by Usertype
- Route frequency: Top 10 Station-to-Station paths
